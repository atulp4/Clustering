# Clustering

Various clustering algorithms were used to successfully combine various features into groups. The dataset was taken from a dental chain which had many variables in the dataset that had be clustered together to analyse wha.  The following clustering methods were implemented: 

- Using basic Clustering using K prototype as dataset has both categorical and numerical variables. Also tried PCA. Used various scaling and normalisation methods as well to test results

- Using GMM

- Using Spectral Clustering

- The results were documented and presented
